# Simple PhalconPHP User Login and Registration

Phalcon is a web framework for PHP delivered as a C extension providing high
performance and lower resource consumption.

This is a simple user login and registration feature. Not pretty by any means right now and doesn't feature sessions yet.

Its just plain simple :D
